# Adding a Publication

## Steps to Adding a Publication

0. Come up with a key which is named as `<Year>_<Venue>_<AuthorList>`, where
   `Year` is the year when your paper is published; `Venue` is the
   **_abbreviation_** of the venue; `AuthorList` is the list of the first
   letters of authors' last names.
1. Add a `<KEY>.md` file in this folder, where `KEY` is specified by the rule
   above. Please find an existing file for a recent publication that has
   similar BibTex information (e.g., LNCS vs. IEEE conference, workshop vs.
   journal) to your publication, and use it as template.
2. Create a thumbnail (`<KEY>.png`) **_and_** a teaser (`<KEY>_teaser.png`)
   figure.  [Read more about adding images here](../assets/images/README.md).
   Place the two figures in the
   [assets/images/publications](../assets/images/publications) folder.
3. Upload your publication video (if you have one) and your preview video to 
   YouTube and create an entry in the [video](../_videos) folder.
4. Place your publication in pdf in the [papers](../papers) folder.
