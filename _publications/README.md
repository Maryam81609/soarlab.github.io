# Adding a Publication

Please use the template provided below when adding a new publication. Fill in
all the information to the best of your ability. If you have a preprint, be sure
to update it once the publication has been accepted. If your publication has
been accepted into a journal (congrats!), be sure to check back once you have
the publication details, such as the volume, issue, and page numbers.



## Steps to Adding a Publication

1. Add a `*.md` file in this folder following the template below. Use a unique key, specified below, for your publication's filenames.
2. Add a thumbnail **_and_** a larger teaser figure to the [assets/images/publications](../assets/images/publications] folder. [Read more about adding images here](../assets/images/README.md).
3. Upload your publication video (if you have one) and your preview video to YouTube and create an entry in the [videos folder](../_videos) folder.
4. Upload the following files to `/usr/sci/www/vdl/papers`:
    - publication PDF (`KEY.pdf`) - *mandatory*
    - thumbnail figure (`KEY.png`) - *mandatory*
    - teaser figure (`KEY_teaser.png`) - *strongly recommended*
    - Supplementary Material PDF (`KEY_supplement.pdf`)
    - full video (`KEY.mp4`)
    - preview video (`KEY_preview.mp4`)


## Publication Template

Modify the template below for your publication. Feel free to leave entries
blank if they are not needed. You can also remove comments or unused fields.
Each publication _**must**_ specify a `title`, `authors`, `bibentry`, and `year`
in order to render proper BibTeX output.


``` yaml

## Keys and Filenames

Each publication must have a unique key following this pattern:
`YYYY_CONFSHORTNAME_PAPERSHORTNAME`


All files for your publication should use this key consistently, only varying by
the file extension. For example: `2016_eurovis_pathfinder.pdf`


However, if there are multiple files of the same extension type, then the
"secondary" type specified with an underscore, as in
`2016_eurovis_pathfinder_supplement.pdf`.


_NOTE:_ We currently require you to re-type this key when specifying your files
and images. See the template for an example. In the future, we could remove
this if all publications follow the keys exactly. We would need to specify to
Jekyll/Liquid when it should look for such a file/image, though, perhaps using
the file extension or even just a simple period/dot or true/y would work.
