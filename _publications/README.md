# Adding a Publication

## Steps to Adding a Publication

0. The key of your paper should be of the following format
   `<Year>_<Venue>_<AuthorList>`, where `Year` is the year when your paper is
   published; `Venue` is the **_abbreviation_** of the venue; `AuthorList` is the
   list of the first letters of authors' last names. The key should be in
   all lower case letters.
1. Add a `<KEY>.md` file in this folder, where `KEY` is specified by the rule
   above. Please find an existing file of a recent publication that has
   similar BibTex information (e.g., LNCS vs. IEEE conference, workshop vs.
   journal) to your publication, and use it as a template.
2. Create a thumbnail (`<KEY>.png`) **_and_** a teaser (`<KEY>_teaser.png`)
   image.  [Read more about adding images here](../assets/images/README.md).
   Place the two images in the
   [assets/images/publications](../assets/images/publications) folder.
3. Upload your publication video (if you have one) and your preview video to 
   YouTube and create an entry in the [video](../_videos) folder.
4. Place your publication in pdf (`<KEY>.pdf`) in the [papers](../papers) folder.
